We provide our implementation and pretrained models as open source in this repository.

Visit our [demo page](https://fastdiff.github.io/) for audio samples.

# News
- April.22, 2021: **FastDiff** accepted by IJCAI 2022. The expected release time of the full version codes (including pre-trained models, more datasets, and more neural vocoders) is at the IJCAI-2022 conference (before July. 2022). Please star us and stay tuned! 

# Quick Started
We provide an example of how you can generate high-fidelity samples using FastDiff.

To try on your own dataset, simply clone this repo in your local machine provided with NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN and follow the below intructions.

## Pretrained Model

You can also use pretrained models we provide.
Details of each folder are as in follows:

| Dataset  | Config                                         | Pretrained Model | 
|----------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| LJSpeech | `modules/FastDiff/config/FastDiff.yaml`          | [Coming  Soon]() |
| LibriTTS | `modules/FastDiff/config/FastDiff_libritts.yaml` | [Coming  Soon]() |
| VCTK     | `modules/FastDiff/config/FastDiff_vctk.yaml`     | [Coming  Soon]() |

Put the checkpoints in `checkpoints/your_experiment_name/model_ckpt_steps_*.ckpt`

## Dependencies
See requirements in `requirement.txt`:
- [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
- [librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa)
- [tacotron2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) (source included in this repo)

## Multi-GPU
By default, this implementation uses as many GPUs in parallel as returned by `torch.cuda.device_count()`. 
You can specify which GPUs to use by setting the `CUDA_DEVICES_AVAILABLE` environment variable before running the training module.

## Inference from wav file
1. Make `wavs` directory and copy wav files into the directory.
2. Set `N` for reverse sampling, which is a trade off between quality and speed. 
3. Run the following command.
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU python tasks/run.py --config path/to/config  --exp_name your_experiment_name --infer --hparams='test_input_dir=wavs,N=$N'
```

Generated wav files are saved in `checkpoints/your_experiment_name/` by default.<br>

## Inference for end-to-end speech synthesis
1. Make `mels` directory and copy generated mel-spectrogram files into the directory.<br>
You can generate mel-spectrograms using [Tacotron2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2), 
[Glow-TTS](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/glow-tts) and so forth.
2. Set `N` for reverse sampling, which is a trade off between quality and speed. 
3. Run the following command.
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU python tasks/run.py --config  --exp_name your_experiment_name --infer --hparams='test_mel_dir=mels,use_wav=False,N=$N'
```
Generated wav files are saved in `checkpoints/your_experiment_name/` by default.<br>


# Train your own model

### Data Preparation and Configuraion ##
1. Set `raw_data_dir`, `processed_data_dir`, `binary_data_dir` in the config file
2. Download dataset to `raw_data_dir`. Note: the dataset structure needs to follow `egs/datasets/audio/*/pre_align.py`, or you could rewrite `pre_align.py` according to your dataset.
3. Preprocess Dataset 
```bash
# Preprocess step: unify the file structure.
python data_gen/tts/bin/pre_align.py --config path/to/config
# Binarization step: Binarize data for fast IO.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU python data_gen/tts/bin/binarize.py --config path/to/config
```

### Training the Refinement Network
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU python tasks/run.py --config path/to/config  --exp_name your_experiment_name --reset
```

### Training the Noise Predictor Network
Given a well-trained refinement network, we start training the scheduling network (noise predictor in paper)
### Noise Scheduling (Optional)
- Given a well-trained FastDiff (refinement and scheduling network), we can then perform noise scheduling to select the best noise schedule suitable to your needs (trade-off between performance v.s. step number), following [BDDM](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/bddm). 
- Put the derived `noise_schedule` in config file

Or you can use our pre-derived `noise_schedule` in config file

### Inference

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU python tasks/run.py --config path/to/config  --exp_name your_experiment_name --infer
```
